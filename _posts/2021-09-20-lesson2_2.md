## Questions

- If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device? Choose one:

```The counter is reset to 0, but the contents of the EditText is preserved.```

- What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs? Choose one:

```Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().```

- When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called? Choose one:  

```onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.```

- Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed? Choose one:

```onPause() or onStop()```
