## What I have done

I have successfully used LiveData and ViewModel to display my ToDo list createad and they still persist after I reopened/killed the application. I have looked up various YouTube tutorials but they were really different from what we are expecting. I basically have re-written this whole application for about 3 to 4 times and in the end, I kind of gave in and follow Adrienne's code.

# What did not work at this point

The update part worked fine in the older version. In this version, I have been debugging for almost 2 days and looked up a tons of posts on StackOverflow but had no luck to solve this issue: I cannot retrieve the list even directly from the repository. The application seems loading the live data just fine but when I try to access the list, I always get null pointer which meaning it is not fetching the right list at all. I will consult to Adrienne or maybe look up more tutorials to see if I am able to resolve this issue.
