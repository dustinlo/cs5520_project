# Final Project Proposal

## What I will do
In the final project, I would like to continue working on the todo application that we are building.

## What I must do
- Add ability to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping

	The ability of dragging and dropping in a todo list seems essential to me so I will for sure implement this into my todo application.
- Make my notifications more robust

	Right now my notification is working fine but there are some flaws that can be improved so I will be working on this to make it closer to production-ready level.


## What I might do if I have time
- Integrate adding a location to a todo
	
	this might be one very interesting feature to be added if I have extra time to complete the application. For those who really use to-do list to its maximum potential, this is an important featre in my opinion because there might be duplicated to-dos with tasks that have to be done in different locations.
